How to Access Your Sling TV Member Sign In
To sign in to your Sling TV member account, begin by visiting the official Sling TV website on your computer or mobile browser. If you’re using a streaming device like Roku, Apple TV, or Amazon Fire Stick, open the Sling TV app.

On the homepage or welcome screen, look for the Sign In option. Click or tap it, and you’ll be taken to a login screen. Enter the email address and password you used when creating your Sling TV member account. Double-check for typos, especially on mobile devices where autocorrect might interfere.

After entering your credentials, click the Sign In button. Once authenticated, you’ll be directed to your dashboard, where you can start watching live channels, explore the on-demand library, or manage your account settings.

Forgot Your Password? Here’s What to Do
If you’ve forgotten your password, don’t worry. On the Sling TV member sign in screen, click on Forgot Password? You’ll be prompted to enter your email address. Once submitted, Sling TV will send a password reset link to your inbox.

Follow the instructions in the email to set a new password. Once done, return to the sign-in page and log in using your updated credentials. If you don’t receive the email right away, check your spam or junk folder.

Sign In From Any Device
One of the perks of having a Sling TV member account is the flexibility to watch from virtually anywhere. You can sign in on a wide range of devices including smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, gaming consoles, and web browsers.

Just download the Sling TV app from your device’s app store, install it, and open it. You’ll be prompted to sign in using your email and password. Once logged in, you’ll have access to all your favorite channels and content.

Managing Your Sling TV Account After Sign In

Keeping Your Sling TV Member Account Secure
